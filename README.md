# vuejs-sqljs-boilerplate
This is a boilerplate to use both [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [sql.js](https://github.com/kripken/sql.js/) together

Example sqlite db file is in src/assets/mytest.db

This will load mytest.db into vue.js and rows in sqlite database, are displayed in helloworld component.

Not only this example shows how we use Vuex store to load db file from server,
But also, we can see how vue component and Vuex store interact each other.

## Build Setup
